

1) Controls textures in a list each with an ID and info required for the basic object.
2) This list will have the id's each of these will be hard coded into controls
3) this allows the reskinning of controls by changing the xml files
4) as we are using xml files they can vevalidated by a schema.
5) this list will be used by the control manager to prelod the textures
6) each control will on creation look to the list to reference its texture.
7) each control therefor requires a reference to the control manager on creation, 
8) the reference does not need to be stored.
9) this list is seperate to any game similar game lists.
10) this process could be repeated for spritefonts


This will give us a control that can be loaded with a custom texture at run time.

Then we have to do sub controls.
1) the positioning of controls within controls.
2) dealing with clipping issues (if an inner control passes beyond window border).
3) the sizing of controls within controls.
4) managing sizing on resizing of parent.
5) managing the position of sub controls on the repositioning of a parent.
